# Anon Web Link Example - React

This sample demonstrates how to use the Anon's linking library to connect to integrations like Instagram.

## Setup

First, follow this repo's `README`.

To run this example, you'll need to verify environment variables and install dependencies.

### Environment Variables

This sample has a `.env.template` file that you should copy to a new file called `.env` in the same directory. Fill in the environment variables with the credentials Anon provided you.

Then source the `.env` file.

```sh
source .env
```

## Install Dependencies

Install your dependencies with npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install --update-checksums
```

## Running the Example

Start your app with:

```sh
npm run start
# or
yarn run start
```

You should see a window pop up for Anon to connect to your account (eg Instagram). Click "Continue", then "Login to X" to save your user session!
