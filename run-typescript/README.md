# Anon Backend SDK Typescript Example

This sample demonstrates how to use the Anon's TypeScript SDK to connect to integrations like Instagram.

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

Install your dependencies with npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Set your API Key

Paste your API Key in at the top of `index.tsx`.
You can get your API Key at [https://console.anon.com]

## Running the Example

Start your app with:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

You should see a Playwright browser open and navigate to Instagram using Anon's browser context. From there, you can interact with Instagram as if you were this user.

Other examples in this folder demonstrate how to use the Anon SDK to interact with other services like Amazon and LinkedIn.
